# 👋 Welcome!

We’re using Discussions as a place to connect with other members of our community. We hope that you:
  * Ask questions you’re wondering about.
  * Help solve problems other folks are having.
  * Engage with other community members.
  * Welcome others and are open-minded. Remember that this is a community we build together 💪.

Got an idea or suggestion about any of our products that doesn't quite fit into a bug report? Take a look at the idea forums. Here are some suggestions to help make your ideas more likely to be implemented:
  * ✅ Make your suggestion as complete and actionable as you can.
  * 💬 Share your ideas with peers so that we can see community demand for them.
  * 👍 Engage with other ideas and provide constructive feedback.
 
Remember that as much as we'd like to, we cannot take every suggestion or build every new idea. Focusing on doing fewer things better is how we build the tools that you love.


## Get started with the _Discussions_ tab above.

Share your thoughs, ideas, and questions. Help each other solve problems. If you'd like other ways to engage, see the "connect with us box on https://www.puppet.com/community.


## Reporting dashboards

See the [`dashboards`](dashboards/) directory for various reporting dashboards. Most are there to help us improve our own OSS housekeeping, but you're welcome to observe. And some of the boards are for you; for example during the month of October the [Hacktoberfest board](dashboards/hacktoberfest.md) will populate with a list of our OSS repos participating and provide a list of pull requests that our engineers should prioritize so you get credit for them.


## Project-specific discussions
In addition to this forum,some individual open-source projects have their own discussion boards. If you're specifically interested in any of these, we'd love for you to come join us!
   * [Bolt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/discussions)
   * [Puppet VSCode extension](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-vscode/discussions)

Please remember that our [community guidelines](https://puppet.com/community/community-guidelines) apply to all community spaces, including this one.
